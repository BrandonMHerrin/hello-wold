This is a simple node.js program that logs Hell0, World! to the console.

The purpose of the application is to show how easy a node js application can be.

# Development Environment

I used vscode and nvm to manage the version of npm that I'm using. 
I chose to use the latest version of node with long term support which at this time 
is 22.17.0

I chose to use vanilla javascript.
